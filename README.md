#  Healthcare Patient Data Analysis and Manipulation
#  Methodology and Summary of the Healthcare Database Project

#  A. Data Exploration and Manipulation

1. Extracting and Analyzing Data:
In this script i uses SELECT DISTINCT to retrieve unique patient records and analyze specific attributes like age.

2. Data Transformation:
Here i uses this script to creates a function AgeCategory to categorize patients based on age.
It adds a new column BillingAmountUpgrade to calculate an additional billing amount.

#  B. Database Management and Security
   
1. Schema Modification:
I uses thid script to ALTER TABLE to add new columns to existing tables.

2. Data Integrity and Automation:
I created a Triggers (BillingAmountUpgrade trigger) which automatically update data based on specific events.

3. User Management
Here used the script to demonstrates creating a new user (evans) and granting/revoking privileges on the database table.

4. Backup and Restore (shown as examples):
I used this to showcase essential practices for database maintenance and disaster recovery.

# Summary:
In this project i explores various functionalities for managing and manipulating data in a healthcare database. I demonstrated techniques for data analysis, transformation, automation, and security. And there're specific functionalities that are not tied to a single purpose, I used them to provide a foundation for building a robust and secure healthcare database system.

Note: In This Project i did'nt consider ethical and regulatory aspects (like HIPAA), but it serves as a starting point for building a comprehensive healthcare database management system.
Data Source: This is a Simulated Healthcare Data: This project utilizes a Python-generated dataset mimicking real-world healthcare data.
